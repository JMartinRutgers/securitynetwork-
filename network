1. View All Active Connections
netstat Commands for Security Monitoring
# Show all active connections and listening ports
netstat -tuplan

# Breakdown of flags:
# -t: TCP connections
# -u: UDP connections
# -p: Show process/program name
# -l: Show only listening sockets
# -a: Show all sockets (listening and established)
# -n: Show numerical addresses
2. Check for Suspicious Listening Ports


2. Check for Suspicious Listening Ports
# Show only listening ports
netstat -tlpn

# Show processes listening on unusual high ports (>50000)
netstat -tlpn | grep -E ':[5-9][0-9]{4}'

3. Monitor Established Connections
# Show only established connections
netstat -tpn | grep ESTABLISHED

# Count connections per IP
netstat -tpn | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr


4. Check for Common Attack Patterns
# Look for SYN_RECV states (possible SYN flood)
netstat -tpn | grep SYN_RECV | wc -l

# Check for many connections from single IP (possible DoS)
netstat -tpn | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 10

5. Common Suspicious Indicators
Large numbers of CLOSE_WAIT or FIN_WAIT states
Multiple connections to unusual ports
Connections to known malicious IPs
Excessive number of connections from single source

lsof Commands for Security Analysis
1. Network Connection Overview

# Show all network connections
lsof -i

# Show only IPv4 connections
lsof -i4

# Show only IPv6 connections
lsof -i6

2. Monitor Specific Ports
# Check specific port
lsof -i:80

# Check port ranges
lsof -i:1-1024

# Show all listening ports
lsof -i -sTCP:LISTEN

3. Process-Specific Monitoring
# Check connections for specific process
lsof -c process_name

# Monitor connections by specific user
lsof -u username

4. Advanced Security Checks
# Check for deleted but still open files (possible malware)
lsof +L1

# Check for processes with unknown network connections
lsof -i | grep -v "(ESTABLISHED|LISTEN)"

# Monitor UDP connections (often used in attacks)
lsof -i UDP
